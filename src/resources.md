## OCaml and Functional Programming

Programming assignments for this course use the [OCaml][] language. Here are some [instructions for installing OCaml][install]. (In contrast with that guide, I recommend [Homebrew][] on macOS: just type `brew install ocaml`.)

[ocaml]: https://ocaml.org
[homebrew]: https://brew.sh
[install]: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2020sp/install.html

If you are already familiar with another functional programming language, OCaml will be quick to pick up. If you're new to functional programming, however, you might want to spend some time at the beginning of the semester getting up to speed. Here are some resources for learning OCaml:

* [Try OCaml][try] is a tutorial you can follow in your browser.
* [The CS 3110 tutorial][3110tut] is accessible and thorough.
* The book [*Real World OCaml*][rwo] is fantastic and free to read online.

## Textbooks You Might Like

There are no required textbooks, but if you find yourself wanting extra background, you might find these textbooks helpful:

* *The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages* by Glynn Winskel.
* *Types and Programming Languages* by Benjamin C. Pierce.

And here are a couple of good online textbooks that are relevant to the course:

* [*Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation*](http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Books/ProgLangs/) by Shriram Krishnamurthi.
* [*Software Foundations*](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/) by Benjamin C. Pierce and a supporting cast.


## Extra Background

Here are some well-written materials on standard PL topics:

* For a self-contained overview of *structural induction*, see [some notes by John A. Thywissen for a class at UT Austin][thywissen].
* For an overview of notation for inference rules, semantics, and types, see this [crash-course blog post by Jeremy Siek][siek].

## LaTeX

There are many options for typesetting inference rules and derivation rules in LaTeX.
We recommend [mathpartir][], which is included with most TeX distributions.
